## General info 
This project is a resource hub for car owners to find resources for maintenance on their vehicles easily. 

## Technologies
This Project was created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* fullPageJS Library
* NHTSA API

## Plans
My plans for this project is to not only be a resource to find owners manuals and forums to reference for maintenance purposes but also to be an online vehicle logbook for users to track their maintenance tasks and be reminded when certain maintenance intervals are coming soon. 

## Learning
This project has expanded my knowledge with the use of libraries and APIs. I've also become much more confident in using DOM maniuplation specifically with JQuery. I also learned about some of the drawbacks of using HTML forms. I experienced an issue where at refresh, the webpage wouldn't respond to the first entry of the VIN, because when the submit button was clicked, it reloaded the page and lost the VIN that was initially entered.
